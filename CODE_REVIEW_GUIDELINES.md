## Review Process

### 1. Initial Review
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New PR] --> B{Self Review}
    B --> C[Request Review]
    C --> D{Initial Check}
    D -->|Pass| E[Detailed Review]
    D -->|Fail| F[Request Changes]
```

### 2. Review Stages

#### Stage 1: Quick Scan (30 mins max)
- Overall approach
- Major architectural issues
- Security concerns
- Basic functionality

#### Stage 2: Detailed Review (2 hours max)
- Code quality
- Test coverage
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness

#### Stage 3: Final Verification
- Changes implemented
- CI/CD pipeline success
- Documentation updated
- Tests passing

## Response Guidelines

### Providing Feedback

#### Do's
```markdown
‚úÖ "Consider using X pattern here because..."
‚úÖ "This might be more efficient if..."
‚úÖ "Great solution for handling X!"
‚úÖ "Would you mind explaining the reasoning behind..."
```

#### Don'ts
```markdown
‚ùå "This is wrong"
‚ùå "Why did you do this?"
‚ùå "I wouldn't do it this way"
‚ùå "This needs to be changed"
```

### Comment Types

#### Required Changes
```markdown
[Required] Please add error handling for this edge case
Reason: System stability could be affected in production
```

#### Suggestions
```markdown
[Suggestion] Consider extracting this logic into a separate service
Benefit: Improved maintainability and reusability
```

#### Questions
```markdown
[Question] How does this handle concurrent requests?
Context: Understanding performance implications
```

#### Praise
```markdown
[Kudos] Excellent job on the optimization here!
Impact: Significant performance improvement
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific examples for your programming language/framework?
2. Include templates for different types of changes (UI, API, Database, etc.)?
3. Add guidelines for specific review scenarios?
4. Include automated code review tool configurations?
5. Add more diagrams or flowcharts for the review process?
